Project Title: Rural Ed Tech Solution


Description:
The Rural Ed Tech Solution is a prototype aimed at bridging the language gap and enabling access to technology for rural areas in India. It leverages Azure Data + Analytics + AI/OpenAI technologies to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to ask questions in their local language and receive responses in the same language after translation to English. The solution focuses on providing educational resources, facilitating communication, and enabling day-to-day activities through technology.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the necessary Azure services and APIs.
4. Set up the database and language processing modules.


Usage:
1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the application through the provided URL.
3. Select the desired language and ask questions in the local language.
4. The system will process the query, translate it to English, understand the intent, fetch relevant information, and present the response in the local language.


Features:
- Language Processing: Utilizes Azure AI services or OpenAI to process queries in the local language.
- Translation: Translates the local language query to English for further processing and understanding.
- Query Understanding: Extracts intents and entities from the translated query to determine the user's needs.
- Information Retrieval: Fetches relevant information from databases or external APIs based on the user's query.
- Response Generation: Generates a response in the local language, providing the user with the requested information.


Architecture:
The solution follows a client-server architecture, where the client is a user interface allowing users to input queries in the local language. The server-side consists of a language processing module, translation module, query understanding module, information retrieval module, and response generation module. The backend infrastructure is built on Azure Data + Analytics + AI services/OpenAI technologies.


Roadmap:
- Enhance language processing capabilities to handle dialects and regional variations.
- Expand the database of educational resources and incorporate real-time data sources.
- Implement advanced AI/ML techniques for better query understanding and response generation.
- Integrate with other technologies, such as voice-based interactions and natural language understanding.
